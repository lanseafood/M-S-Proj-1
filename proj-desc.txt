Problem Description

When modeling traffic flows along a busy, congested street, minimizing average travel time to traverse portions of streets becomes key. The objective of this project is to compare the average travel time for vehicles traveling along a portion of Peachtree Street in midtown Atlanta between a model using synchronized traffic lights versus unsynchronized traffic lights. We define “unsynchronized” as the traffic lights acting independent of each other whereas “synchronized” traffic lights operate on a schedule dependent on each other. However, both scenarios maintain a consistent timing pattern (the light remains green for G seconds, yellow for Y seconds, and red for R seconds, and repeats). 

The NGSIM dataset giving precise data measurements for traffic flows along Peachtree Street in Atlanta from 4:00pm-4:15pm was used extensively in the course of developing a traffic simulation model. Specifically, vehicle velocities, and locations (in terms of a particular intersection or section) were used. 

Figure 1 (ADD THIS FIGURE) below depicts the portion of Peachtree Street to be modeled. We define intersections as the point where a vehicle has the option of turning right, left, or continuing straight. Intersections are labeled from 1-5, 1 being the intersection of Peachtree Street and 10th Street, up until 5 indicating the intersection of Peachtree Street and 14th Street. Furthermore, we define specific sections of the road as the areas in between the intersections, numbered from 1-6, 1 being the portion of Peachtree Street right below intersection 1, 2 indicating the portion of Peachtree Street in between intersection 1 and intersection 2, up until section 6 indicating the portion of Peachtree Street beyond intersection 5. 

The problem therefore becomes one of developing a model of Peachtree Street, specifically of sections 1-6. The objectives of the study include:
•	development of a conceptual model for the simulation, 
•	the simulation model itself, 
•	data analysis (primarily from the given NGSIM dataset), 
•	verification, validation, and calibration of the simulation model, and 
•	analysis of results obtained from the model. 

The conceptual model is essentially a “non-software specific description of the computer simulation model… describing the objectives, inputs, outputs, content, assumptions, and simplifications of the model.” \cite{Robinson} First the questions to be answered by the simulation study must be listed as objectives. The inputs, independent variables varied during experimentation, and outputs, metrics obtained from the model, are key to understanding the workings of the model. Finally, assumptions (made for implementation of the model based off of lack of data) and simplifications (made to simplify the model, ie to reduce development time) are noted in the conceptual model. 

The simulation model is based on a queuing network conceptual model. The elements of a queueing model include the server (a serial reusable resource that assumes service times for successive customers are independent and identically distributed), the customers (the entities in the model that use the resource serially; their arrival process must be specified), and the queue (what holds the customers waiting to use the server). Additionally, the simulation model is to be operated on an event-driven time advance mechanism and is to be stochastic. 

Data collection consists of determining appropriate model parameters based off of the given NGSIM dataset. Geographic data collection is also required, namely distances of the areas being modeled, which can be obtained from google maps. 

Do we need to talk about queues, event lists etc here? Who knows
